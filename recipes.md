steps to cook spaghetti:

Make the meat sauce. Add the beef and sausage to a large skillet over medium-high heat, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the onion and garlic. Cook until meat is browned, about 6-8 minutes. Drain the fat from the meat.
Add the sugar, Italian seasoning, salt, basil, and black pepper to the skillet with the cooked meat. Stir well.
Add the tomato paste. Stir until no large clumps of tomato paste remain.
Add the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir until well combined. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the sauce for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the minced parsley.
As the sauce is simmering, cook the pasta al dente according to its package directions. Drain the pasta well, and return it to the large pot used for boiling.
Pour the meat sauce over the pasta. Stir well. Add the parmesan cheese to the pasta. Stir well. Let the spaghetti rest in the meat sauce for 5 minutes before serving to let the pasta absorb some of the sauce.

done now you have spaghetti
